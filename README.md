Creating RegExp in a string representation often lead to solutions that are hard to maintain. On the other side RegExp allow to build powerful solutions.
This interface allows to leverage RegExp with a human-readable interface.

## TODO
- Add CICD
- Improve test coverage
- Move from internal string representation to regexp/syntax representation
